# `PathoSurveilR`: an R package for analysis of the `pathogensurveillance` pipeline

`PathoSurveilR` is an R package with functions that can read, summarize, plot, and manipulate data produced by the pipeline [`pathogensurveillance`](https://github.com/nf-core/pathogensurveillance). 


```{r include=FALSE}
options(tibble.print_min = 5, tibble.print_max = 5)
```


## Installation

Although `PathoSurveilR` is not on CRAN yet, you can install the development version from the source code on Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/PathoSurveilR")
```


## Introduction

Most functions in the `PathoSurveilR` package have the same way of accepting input.
Given one or more directory paths, functions will find their needed input in any `pathogensurveillance` output directories that are in the given directories.
For example, an output directory of `pathogensurveillance` is included in the package and its path on your computer can be found like so:

```{r}
library(PathoSurveilR)
path <- system.file('extdata/ps_output', package = 'PathoSurveilR')
print(path)
```

This path can then be used as the only required input for nearly every function in `PathoSurveilR`.
For example, here is how to get the multigene phylogeny plot, which contains core gene phylogenies for prokaryotes and busco phylogenies for eukaryotes:

```{r, message=FALSE}
multigene_tree_plot(path)[[2]]  # This function returns a list of plots, so [[2]] selects the second plot
```

And here is how to get the best matches for each sample using an estimate of ANI:

```{r}
estimated_ani_match_table(path)
```

Many functions also have an option for interactive output for use in HTML documents.
Since this is a markdown document (`README.md`), interactive plots will not work but here is a screenshot of an interactive plot showing the taxonomic distribution of sendsketch hits:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, message=FALSE}
sendsketch_taxonomy_plot(path, interactive = TRUE)
```

You can also get more low level information from the pipeline results to do custom analyses.
For example, functions ending with `_path` or `_path_data` give you the paths of various types of `pathogensuriveillance` outputs, returning `vector`s or `tibble`s of paths respectively:

```{r}
estimated_ani_matrix_path(path)
core_tree_path_data(path)
sendsketch_path_data(path)
```

You can also get parsed versions of all of these `pathogensuriveillance` outputs using functions ending in `parsed`:

```{r}
sendsketch_parsed(path)
core_tree_parsed(path)
```

Functions that use the same data always start with the same words, so if you know what data out want to look at, you can see all the ways that `PathoSurveilR` can interact with it by typing `PathoSurveilR::` in an IDE like RStudio followed by the data type name and hit `<TAB>` to see autocomplete suggestions.
For example `PathoSurveilR::estimated_ani_` + `<TAB>` will show all of these functions:

* `estimated_ani_heatmap`
* `estimated_ani_match_table`
* `estimated_ani_matrix_path`
* `estimated_ani_matrix_path_data`
* `estimated_ani_matrix_parsed`
