\usage{
estimated_ani_heatmap(
  path,
  combine = FALSE,
  interactive = FALSE,
  max_size = 100,
  prefer_contextual = TRUE,
  height = NULL,
  width = NULL,
  dpi = 100,

  max_label_length = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to one or more folders that contain pathogensurveillance
output or paths to tree files.}

\item{combine}{If \code{TRUE}, combine data from all ANI matrices found into a
single plot.}

\item{interactive}{Whether to use an HTML-based interactive format or not
(default: TRUE)}

\item{max_size}{The maximum number of rows/columns to plot. To subset the
data to this amount when needed, references most similar to the samples
will be used. If there are more samples than this, then only samples will
be plotted. This does not subset samples. See 'prefer_contextual` as well}

\item{prefer_contextual}{How subsets of rows/columns are chosen when
\code{max_size} takes effect. If \code{TRUE} and contextual references have been
chosen, give preference to including them.}

\item{height}{The height in pixels. If not \code{interactive}, this is divided by
\code{dpi} to convert it to inches.}

\item{width}{The width in pixels. If not \code{interactive}, this is divided by
\code{dpi} to convert it to inches.}

\item{dpi}{How pixels are converted to inches}

\item{font_size}{Size of text used for labels}

\item{max_label_length}{Labels longer than this length will be shortened.}
}
\value{
A list of plots, unless \code{combine} is used, in which case a single
plot is returned.
}
\description{
Plot ANI matrix with dendrogram from data present in the output of a
pathogensurveillance run.

\examples{
path <- system.file('extdata/ps_output', package = 'PathoSurveilR')
