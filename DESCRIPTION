Description: Utilities for interacting with the pathogensurveillance pipeline.
  Provides functions to easily find, read, analyze, and plot the contents of
  output directories of pathogensurveillance. In addition, the pipeline uses
  this package to parse input files, allowing for users to validate input files
  outside of the pipleine before running it. Pathogensurveillance also uses this
  package to generate most of the figures and tables in the output reports, allowing
  users to generate more customized versions of these when needed.
